## Making Your First Contentful Delivery API Call

:warning: IN PROGRESS

As a Support Engineer for [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), we frequently get asked these two questions by new users:
- What is content modeling?
- How does the content that is stored in Contentful get rendered on my website?

To help us better understand the relationship between your [content model](√), the editor interface of our web app, and the output to your end product, I've created a template for a make-believe home goods business called Urbän Hømesteäd (when I came up with this name, I was just off of a vacation high from a winter trip to the Scandinavian countries...what can I say :grimacing:).

To make this project as easy as possible, we do not need to install packages or use the command line at all in order to view our sample web page. We will simply be using three files on your computer (`.html`, `.css`, and `.js`)--you can download the starter code here.

Let's begin!

:white_check_mark: _The JavaScript for this project is based on a previous showcase of our sample [Product Catalogue](https://github.com/contentful/product-catalogue-js). JSFiddle [here](https://jsfiddle.net/trodrigues/btvhh4ma/)._
